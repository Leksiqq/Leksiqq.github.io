# DataSwitch class

Used in XAML markup similar to `<DataTrigger>`. Has a `Binding` attribute with the same meaning. The content consists of `<DataTrigger>` elements without a `Binding` attribute. Acts as if all `<DataTrigger>`s have the same `Binding`, but the binding value is only evaluated once.

### Example
in the [demo](Demo) on the "Demo3" tab, calls to the calculation of the binding value are displayed on the console in the case of using `<DataSwitch>` and without it.
